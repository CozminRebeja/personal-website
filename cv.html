        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My design career started when I was 15 years old. My cousin showed me
          a mind-blowing program at the time called Photoshop. It hooked me
          instantly, so I decided to try it out myself. Through online platforms
          like YouTube, I studied the ins and outs of graphic design. And by the
          time I was 16, I got a job at a local firm in Chisinau. Five years
          later, I am working as a freelance UI/UX Designer, collaborating with
          other talented people to create stunning visuals and solve real-life
          problems.
